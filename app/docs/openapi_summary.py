SUMMARY = """
The Sign Language Portal is a testing and learning platform for sign
languages. The platform aims to facilitate access to sign language
learning and testing, and help the world become more inclusive. The
platform is divided into a backend and a frontend part. This part (the
API) is used to process the whole business logic behind this by
accepting requests, doing the processing and then providing responses.
The requests and responses can be sent and received by another part of
the project, the frontend, which will render everything user-friendly
in a browser.
