DESCRIPTION = """
## Description
This is the [OpenAPI][1] documentation for the backend [API of the Sign
Language Portal (SLPortal)][2]. The documentation is used to be able to
view the full functionality of the API and to understand the use of the
endpoints, which can also be tried out through this interface.

### Domain language
A domain specific language is used for the endpoints and parameters. We
want to explain the most important words for you to help you understand
what each endpoint is trying to achieve.

#### Assessment
An assessment is basically a series of questions and possible answers
to them. It is used to present to a learner as an exam or for learning
purposes. An assessment does not have to consist exclusively of
question-choices pairs. It can also include other elements such as a
video that tells a story before questions. The format of the questions
and answers (text, images, videos, etc.) is not important for the
assessment itself.

#### Submission
A submission is the result of an assessment after the learner or person
being assessed has gone through an assessment and given the choice of
possible answers. Submission therefore contains the answers to a
particular assessment in a structured form so that it can then be
scored or evaluated.
